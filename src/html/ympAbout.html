    <h1>MANATO YAMASHITA</h1>
    <h2>Hello, hello.</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm MANATO YAMASHITA, a japanese age of 19 student who born in Kumamoto now live in Kanagawa and Tokyo.
         this website is for my self-introduction. so to speak this is portfolio.</p>
    <p>I am majoring in COMPUTER SCIENCE and INFOMATICS ENGINERRINGs in Tokyo-City-University at Yokohama,
         so this web site is to practice them I learned .
    <br>I am a classic GEEK for Animations, personality is Neither Humanities nor Sciences people.</p>

    <h2>Lightly and lightly.</h2>
    <p>As you read, this site is written by English, regardless I'm japanese student. 
        why? because it's just looks cool isn't it? Therefore it's merely for satisfaction for me!</p>

    <p>But honestly I think that it's important to create firstly whatever. Fortunately I'm a university student, 
      so I don't have to cosider for customers. In university, I met friends having greate skills of the same age,
        "What a respectfull man!" I was excited, but "I can't such an amazing performances. I can nothing now..." also I thought.
        So I decided to practice writting cording. This is my first work. please note. 
    </p>
